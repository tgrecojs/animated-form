            <p class="states"> Shortly after focusing on front end developer, I became aware of the Node JavaScript engine; and I was interested in it the very beginning due to the performance that is has received praise for. In turn, I decided to dedicate countless hours throughout the past summer towards gaining a deeper understanding of Isomorphic JavaScript. The amount of focus I spent on learning node from every angle possible resulted in a greater understand of development as a whole. As a result of this, I have developed a mindset to develop applications that are centered around those using it so that I ensure the best UX possible. Additionally, I want to continue working more in detail on things such as testing code to ensure a solid UI, developing hybrid applications, so that I am can continue working to make an impact in web development; and I believe my sincere passion to learn, and dedication to development make me an ideal player on a development squad. I have become very interested in creating great user experiences, as well as workflow automation
